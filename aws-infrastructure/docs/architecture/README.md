# Architecture Documentation

This directory contains architectural documentation for the AWS infrastructure.

## Architecture Patterns Implemented

### 1. Core Infrastructure
- Multi-account setup with AWS Organizations
- Centralized logging and monitoring
- Network segmentation with VPCs and Transit Gateway
- Security baseline with IAM, KMS, and security services

### 2. Application Patterns
- **Microservices**: Service mesh, API gateway patterns
- **Serverless**: Lambda-based architectures
- **Data Platforms**: Data lakes, streaming, and batch processing
- **ML Platforms**: Training, inference, and MLOps pipelines

### 3. Deployment Patterns
- Blue-Green deployments
- Canary releases
- Infrastructure as Code with CloudFormation
- GitOps workflows

## Getting Started

1. Review the architectural decision records (ADRs)
2. Understand the naming conventions
3. Follow the deployment procedures
4. Implement monitoring and alerting

## Best Practices

- Use least privilege access
- Implement proper tagging
- Enable logging and monitoring
- Regular security assessments
- Cost optimization reviews
